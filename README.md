Ethermap
=========

Ethermap is a real-time collaborative map editor allowing:
* synchronization of geoobjects between all clients
* highlight changes for user-awareness
* store each change as a new revision
* browse revisions and show changes in the map context
* revert to older revisions or restore deleted features


[How does it work?](How_does_it_work.md) shortly explains the overall concept.

For a [demo](http://giv-wilhelm.uni-muenster.de), open the following website with several browsers log into the same map id and different user names.


The application has been built as part of my master thesis at the ifgi (Institute for Geoinformatics, WWU MÃ¼nster).
